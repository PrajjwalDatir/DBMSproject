The main idea behind the project was to create a management application, where faculties and students 
can do their respective work effeciently.

The project contains two panels:-

1)Admin Planel - A centralized, easy to use and time utilization panel which focusses on functionalities like adding/deleting sessions, keeping a track on semester, department, different records of courses, registering students, enroll history and student logs.

2)Student Panel - Students can log into their respective accounts and enroll to different courses, access their profile and change password if required.

Unlike the Traditional way of storing student's record on registers and manual files, we tried to
make it digital and address all the problems faced by students and school administration.

Technology used:-
We have used PHP for the backend and also MySql for the database creation and manupulation. We have 
designed front end using templates and the Bootstrap, Html and CSS.

Primary School Management Project solve the problems and provides flexibility, less cost, faster access to records and better management of School's important work.
